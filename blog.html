            <p class="title">Relative size</p>
           <article>
            <p>A relative unit gets sizing from something else. In the specification the relative length units are 
                defined as em, ex, ch and rem. These are font-relative lengths. The specification also defines a % 
                value, which is always relative to another value. Using relative values means that things can scale 
                up and down according to some other value.</p>
                <p><strong>%</strong></p>
                <p>Relative to the parent element. A container directly inside the viewport with a width of 90% will 
                    always be 90% of the available width - whether I am on a phone or high resolution display.
                    If I have another container inside that first container with a width of 50%, it takes 50% of the 
                    width of the parent element and not the viewport.  percentage units are a key component in the 
                    flexible grids needed for responsive design.</p>
                <p><strong>em</strong></p>
                <p>Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font). Using ems 
                    as a length unit in layout, and in particular in padding and margins can help to maintain a vertical 
                    rhythm. If a user resizes their text or you decide to make font sizes larger or smaller in your stylesheet, 
                    the em length unit will scale proportionately.</p>
                    <p>Because of the fact that em size is relative to the font size on the element. This can make ems a little 
                        tricky to use. If elements are nested or appear in different contexts in your document you can find that text 
                        or elements sized with ems can appear much smaller or larger than you imagined. </p>
                <p><strong>rem</strong></p>
                <p>The rem (root em) unit is the font-size of the root element, which is usually the html element. As with em, you 
                    can use this value as a length unit and it will always remain relative to the root element. You donâ€™t get the 
                    nesting issue as we saw with em. This makes it easier for you to set sizes relative to a font size declared on 
                    the root element, no matter what context the element is in.</p>
                <p><strong>Tip</strong> The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!</p>

            <p class="title">Default browser width </p>
           <article>
               <p>Setting the font size in pixel values (px) is a good choice when you need pixel accuracy. A px value is static.
                    This is an OS-independent and cross-browser way of literally telling the browsers to render the letters at 
                    exactly the number of pixels in height that you specified. The results may vary slightly across browsers, 
                    as they may use different algorithms to achieve a similar effect.</p>
                <p>Font sizing settings can also be used in combination. For example, if a parent element is set to 16px and 
                    its child element is set to larger(200px), the child element displays larger than the parent element in the page.</p>

            <p class="title">Changes in css3 </p>
           <article>
               <p><strong>1. CSS 3 Selectors</strong></p>
               <p>In addition to the selectors that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. 
                Using these selectors, you can choose DOM elements based on their attributes. So, you don't need 
                to specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, you can utilize the attribute field to style 
                them.</p>
                <p><strong>2. CSS 3 Rounded Corners</strong></p>
                <p>Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer 
                    to write a lot of code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a 
                    never-ending chore because any change in content can break them. CSS 3 addresses this problem by 
                    introducing the border-radius property, which gives you the same rounded-corner effect and you don't 
                    have to write all the code.</p>
                <p><strong>3. CSS 3 Border Image</strong></p>
                <p>Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property 
                    border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.</p>
                <p><strong>4. CSS 3 Box Shadow</strong></p>
                <p>A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using 
                    a repeated image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by 
                    writing a single line of CSS code.</p>
                <p><strong>5. CSS 3 Text Shadow</strong></p>
                <p>The new text-shadow property allows you to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage. Prior to CSS 3, 
                    this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it. 
                    A similar property called box-shadow is also available in CSS 3.</p>
